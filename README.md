# Attendance Tracker

This project is for tracking the attendance points system used by my former employer. It currently is still a work in progress. The goal is for profiles with differing roles to be able to access and adjust data in the database. This project is made up of a front-end built with React and CSS and a back-end built with Knex and Express. (back-end code is in seperate project).

### Setup

In order to start up the project install with `npm install` and then use `npm run start`. You should be able to login to the app with "johndoe@eg.com" and "pass"
