# Attendance Tracker

This project is for tracking the attendance points system used by my former employer. It currently is very much still a work in progress and currently only displays the data of the profile that you log in as. The goal is for profiles with differing roles to be able to access and adjust data in the database. This project is made up of a front-end built with React and CSS and a back-end built with Knex and Express. 

### Setup

In order to start up the project install with `npm install` and then use `npm run start` for the front-end and `npm run server` for the back-end
